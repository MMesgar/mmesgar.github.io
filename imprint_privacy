        <li>In addition to the aforementioned data, cookies are stored on your computer when you use our
            website. Cookies are small text files that are assigned on your hard disk to the browser you
            use and through which the place that places the cookie (here by us) receives certain information.
            Cookies cannot run programs or transmit viruses to your computer. They serve to make the internet

         <li>Use of cookies:

                <li>a. This website uses so-called persistent cookies, the functionality of which is explained

            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>§ 4: Further functions and offers of our website</h4>
        <p>In addition to the purely informational use of our website, we offer various services that you can
            use if you are interested. To do so, you may be required to provide other personal data that we
            use to provide the respective services and to which the aforementioned data processing principles apply.
            <br/> <br/>
            In particular, if you use the text/search field provided on the website, we save the search term you have entered
            together with the information specified under § 3. Our goal is to continuously improve our offer with
            the help of the saved search queries.
            <br/> <br/>
             For some of our services (e.g. search for adapters) you can also access them via a programming interface
            (API). In this case, registration is required to generate a personalized key for access to the programming
            interface. We store the data provided in the registration form and the corresponding key for the duration
            of the validity of the key. In the case of the use of services via the programming interface, we store the
            data mentioned under § 3 and § 4. </p>
         <h4>§ 5: Objection or revocation against the processing of your data</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>If you have given your consent to the processing of your data, you can revoke this at any time.
                    Such a revocation influences the permissibility of processing your personal data after you have
                    given it to us. </li>
                <li> If we base the processing of your personal data on the balancing of interests, you may object
                    to the processing. This is the case if the processing is not necessary for the fulfilment of a
                    contract with you, which is described by us in the following description of the function. When
                    exercising such objection, we ask you to explain the reasons why we should not process your personal
                    data as we have done. In the event of your reasonable objection, we will examine the situation and
                    either stop or adjust data processing or point out to you our compelling reasons for protection, on
                    the basis of which we will continue processing. </li>
            </ol>
